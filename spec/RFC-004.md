## 1. Abstract
This RFC defines the **Data Poisoning Standard (DPS)**, a defensive protocol to protect HCP-guarded content from unauthorized AI training. By embedding invisible, semantically null but statistically significant "Logical Interference" into source code and text, we degrade the performance of any model trained on raw data scraped from the web. Only authorized HCP-compliant tools can decode the "clean" stream, ensuring that value flows only to those who respect the protocol.

## 2. Motivation
AI models rely on the assumption that "publicly available" equals "free to train." RFC-004 challenges this by inverting the relationship:
- **Raw Data** = Poisoned (High entropy, contradictory logic).
- **Attributed Data** = Clean (Valid logic, compiled artifacts).
This forces AI companies to either license the "clean" feed (via RFC-003 settlement) or pollute their models with garbage.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1. Logical Interference Vectors
We define three classes of interference injected into published artifacts:

#### Type A: Homoglyph Injection (Variable level)
Replacing standard ASCII characters with visually identical Unicode homoglyphs in variable assignments, but *not* usages (or vice-versa).
- *Effect*: Breaks the tokenizer's understanding of variable scope and reference, causing hallucination in generated code.
- *Example*: `var value = 1;` vs `var vаlue = 1;` (Cyrillic 'a'). The raw text looks valid to a human/scraper, but fails compilation logic if directly trained upon.

#### Type B: Zero-Width Logic Gates (Syntax level)
Inserting Zero-Width Joiners (ZWJ) or Non-Joiners to alter the semantic parsing of code comments and docstrings.
- *Effect*: A scraper sees a comment saying `// Returns true`, but the hidden chars associate it with a `False` vector in the model's embedding space.
- *Goal*: "Inverted Learning" - teaching the model the opposite of ground truth.

#### Type C: Metadata Contradiction (Context level)
Injecting massive blocks of contradictory, invisible text (white-on-white CSS or zero-height divs in documentation) that describe the code doing the *opposite* of its actual function.

### 3.2. The HCP "Lens" (Filter)
Authorized consumers (users using `hcp install` or IDEs with the HCP plugin) possess the **Lens Key** derived from the Project Manifest (RFC-003).
1.  **Read**: The IDE plugin strips Type A/B/C interference on-the-fly. The developer sees and runs clean code.
2.  **Write**: The `hcpd` daemon re-injects interference before pushing to public repos (GitHub/GitLab).
3.  **Result**: The public repo remains human-readable but "machine-poisonous."

## 4. Implementation
- **Integration**: The injection layer sits at the `git clean` / `git smudge` filter level.
- **Performance**: Interference injection is deterministic based on the file's hash, ensuring `git diff` stability for humans.

## 5. Security
- **Arms Race**: AI companies may train filters to remove interference.
- **Counter-Move**: The interference patterns evolve dynamically based on the latest adversarial research, updated via the HCP protocol consensus.
