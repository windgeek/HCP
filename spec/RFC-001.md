## 1. Abstract
This Request for Comments (RFC) defines the standard for **HCP-ID**, a self-sovereign identity protocol rooted in the Bitcoin blockchain. By leveraging Bitcoin's `secp256k1` elliptic curve and Taproot (BIP-341) script paths, we create a "Human Layer" that is censorship-resistant, computationally verifiable, and distinct from machine-generated identities. This document specifies the key derivation, on-chain registration, and off-chain attestation methods.

## 2. Motivation
In the age of zero-cost AI generation, "Identity" is the only scarce resource. Traditional PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) relies on centralized CAs (Certificate Authorities). We propose a decentralized PKI (dPKI) where the "Root of Trust" is the proof-of-work energy embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1. The HCP-ID
An HCP-ID is defined as a standard Taproot-compatible Bitcoin public key ($P$).
$$ P = x \cdot G $$
Where:
- $x$ is the private scalar (kept by the human).
- $G$ is the generator point of the `secp256k1` curve.

### 3.2. On-Chain Registration (The "Genesis Signal")
To distinguish an HCP-ID from a standard wallet, the user must broadcast a specific "Genesis Signal" transaction.
*   **OP_RETURN Payload**: The transaction must include an `OP_RETURN` output containing the protocol tag `HCP1` followed by a hash of the user's initial "Bio-Entropy" commitment (see RFC-002).
    ```
    OP_RETURN <0x48435031> <SHA256(Bio_Commitment)>
    ```

### 3.3. The "Human Layer" Concept
We define the **Human Layer** as the set of all UTXOs and off-chain signatures that can be cryptographically traced back to a valid Genesis Signal.
- **Truth Layer**: The Bitcoin Blockchain (Objective consensus, energy-backed).
- **Human Layer**: HCP-signed messages (Subjective intent, bio-backed).

### 3.4. Key Derivation Paths
To separate financial assets from identity assets, HCP wallets usually use a hardened derivation path:
`m / 86' / 0' / 0' / 1337'` 
(1337 is the proposed BIP-44 purpose code for "Leet/Elite/Human" protocols - *pending allocation*).

## 4. Security Considerations
- **Key Loss**: Loss of the private key equates to "Digital Death". Social recovery via Taproot script paths (e.g. 2-of-3 multisig with trusted human peers) is recommended.
- **Sybil Resistance**: While one human can generate multiple keys, the cost of the Genesis Signal (transaction fees) and the requirement for continuous "Bio-Entropy" (RFC-002) makes industrial-scale Sybil attacks economically irrational.
