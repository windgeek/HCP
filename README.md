# HCP: Human Core Protocol

> **"Securing the Kernel of Human Consciousness in the Algorithmic Age."**

### Vision
As Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) begins to dominate production and creativity, the boundary between human-originated thought and machine-generated output is blurring. **HCP** is a decentralized protocol designed to provide an immutable "Proof of Humanity" for digital assets—code, literature, music, and ideas.

### Why HCP?
We believe that human intent carries a unique "creative entropy" that cannot be replicated by probabilistic models. HCP creates a technical border that:
1.  **Validates** human authorship via cryptographic signatures.
2.  **Anchors** creative milestones onto the Bitcoin blockchain.
3.  **Protects** human sovereignty against unauthorized AI training and exploitation.

### Core Pillars
* **Proof of Intent (PoI):** A mechanism to verify the evolutionary process of creation.
* **Sovereign Identity:** Native integration with Bitcoin's `secp256k1` for identity and settlement.
* **Economic Reciprocity:** Enabling the "Human Dividend" through Lightning Network micro-payments.
